<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> To think of it, here I say that four things are red, and feminine usage and judgment call them “burgundy,” “cerise,” “vermilion,” and “rust.” My word, but women insist on a different vocabulary from us men. You would almost think that the women possessed a different language. I am coming to see that there may be some place in linguistics for a woman, namely, to interpret this feminine language which has arisen.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I fear you over-estimate the differences, but it is reported that among some of the Carib Indians the men speak one language and the women speak another language, presumably an Arawak dialect. The tradition is that the Carib men killed off the Arawak men of a tribe and took the women for themselves. In the meantime the men and the women have kept their respective languages. The Chiquitos, an Indian tribe in Bolivia, are reported as having quite different grammatical forms for the women’s dialect of the language as compared with the men’s. We do know that the Yana Indians of California have quite extensive differences of form between the women’s and the men’s language. There is a “feminine” aspect to almost any type of study.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But what do these differences in the use of <em>red</em> have to do with the area of meaning of a word?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It should be quite obvious that the area of meaning of <em>red</em> is much greater in your vocabulary than it is in Miss Ferrell’s. If we chart the colors of the spectrum, your word <em>red</em> is going to cover a wider area than Miss Ferrell’s <em>red</em>. Moreover, it is going to be difficult to know exactly where <em>red</em> leaves off and some other color begins. These words designate not points on the spectrum but areas.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But what about the aboriginal approach to this problem that we began to discuss?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> We are coming to that now. In the Maya language there are six principal color words which may be roughly translated as ‘black,’ ‘white,’ ‘yellow,’ ‘green,’ ‘blue,’ and ‘red.’ All colors may be classified as one of these six.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But there is no word for ‘brown.’ What do they do in such a case as that?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It depends upon the shade of brown. If it is a reddish brown then it goes under ‘red.’ If it is a greenish brown then under ‘green,’ and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Evidently there is no word for ‘purple’ either.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> No. If it is a dark purple, it will go as ‘black,’ and if reddish, as ‘red.’</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But what if the people want to be specific about a color?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> They can do that even as we do. They can say that it is like something else having a particular color.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> No wonder that investigators have thought that aboriginal peoples have very limited vocabularies and speak with considerable looseness of meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> On the other hand, in some areas of meaning, these languages make far more detailed divisions of natural phenomena than we do. Consider what occurs in the Chontal language of Oaxaca. What we normally translate as ‘receive’ occurs in five different stems: the first means ‘to receive seeds’ which must be ground before being consumed, as in the case of coffee beans or corn. The second stem means ‘to receive a liquid,’ the third ‘to receive a small object,’ the fourth ‘to receive food,’ and fifth ‘to receive animate objects,’ such as a horse, pig, or person. Accordingly if a person receives coffee beans, the first stem would describe the action. If the coffee is ground before being received, then the fourth word denotes the action of receiving; but if the coffee has already been brewed, then the second word is employed. One language will divide natural phenomena in one way, and another language in another way. It is all a matter of linguistic perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> That is exactly the difficulty. I am amazed. A man with your evident background and training seems to have no rigid standard, no <em>summum bonum</em>, no traditional authority. You seem to look at all cultures alike. This is a rather curious thing for one to do. It surely marks a definite cleavage between your attitude and mine.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I realize that in many ways I have kept you talking more about anthropology than about linguistics. Excuse me for diverting you so often.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> No apology is necessary. After all, anthropology and linguistics are very closely related, in fact, to some extent identical. When we analyze the culture of a people, we discuss the way in which these people adapt themselves to their physical environment. This we call the material culture. A people’s adaptation to one another is the social culture. The adaptation to the supernatural is the religious culture. There is an additional phase which is found in all these, namely, the esthetic.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I have never heard esthetics discussed by anthropologists as a separate item of culture.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> The importance of this phase is only gradually being appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> Where does the study of the language fit into this picture?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> This comes as the fifth phase of culture.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> My word! How the anthropologists do take in everything! But why do you so consistently refer to anthropological attitudes and views?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> This is because of the fact that one’s anthropological views inevitably dictate one’s attitude toward linguistics. That is precisely why we haven’t been able to separate them in our discussion. We couldn’t have done this if we had tried. We haven’t been wasting time or going far afield by discussing anthropological implications. This is very much in line with Miss Ferrell’s request to know more of what the course is all about.</p>
