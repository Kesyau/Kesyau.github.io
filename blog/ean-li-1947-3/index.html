<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Well, be that as it may, let’s get back to our primitives. The impression which you have about their limited vocabulary and almost awkwardly simple grammar is quite a universal conception. Actual investigation soon dispels this idea. Consider this one word in the San Blas language of Panama, <em>ampo’ittimalasarso·sana</em>. It means ‘the two of us just about hit them, but we did not.’ What we say in twelve words in English, the San Blas Indians may say in one.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> And is that just one word?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> In a somewhat similar way as we define <em>predestination</em> as one word. In English <em>pre-</em>, <em>-de-</em>, <em>-stin-</em>, <em>-a-</em>, <em>-t-</em>, and <em>-ion</em> are all meaningless apart from the combination. It is much the same with this San Blas word. The units have their meaning in combination.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> What do these various parts mean?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Well, <em>am-</em> indicates first person. It is usually <em>an-</em> except before certain bilabial stop consonants, where it becomes <em>am-</em>. We speak of this <em>m</em> as being assimilated.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> That assimilation, I suppose, is the result of the general slovenliness of the speech and the laziness of the people.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Not any more than in English, where the negative prefix <em>in-</em> becomes <em>im-</em> before a word beginning with a bilabial consonant, such as in the word <em>imperfect</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> The situation is rather parallel, I must admit. However, what about the rest of the word?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> The second unit is <em>-po-</em> which means ‘two.’</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But does the language use the same <em>am-</em> or <em>an-</em>, whether a singular or plural, for the first person? Am I right in assuming that a pluralizing ending is added to a singular form? How inadequate to make no distinction as between ‘I’ and ‘we’. It would be the same as saying <em>I-two</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> In some ways the San Blas is better than the English, for we say <em>you</em> for singular and plural and make no indication whatsoever of a distinction between plural and singular references.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I have always decried the loss of <em>thou</em> and <em>thee</em> to contrast with <em>ye</em> and <em>you</em>. It’s the modern intellectual laziness that even creeps into English and corrupts it.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> We may have a chance to discuss this matter later, but be that as it may, let’s examine the San Blas word further. The third unit is <em>-itti-</em>. This is the third person indicator, and the fourth element <em>-mala-</em> pluralizes the third person indicator.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> That is evidently parallel to the first person. I presume one would say <em>anmala-</em> for ‘we.’</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You're absolutely right, Dr. Zilch. It wouldn’t be any time at all before you would be having a great time with these aboriginal languages.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Perish the thought! But one cannot refrain from pointing out a few analogies. That is what comes from classical training.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Fine! Then perhaps you'll become a student of descriptive linguistics all the more rapidly. The stem of the San Blas word we mentioned is <em>-sarso·-</em> which means ‘hit.’ The <em>-sa-</em> suffix shows the past tense, and the <em>-na</em> is a reversive. This particle completely changes the meaning. Instead of the ‘two of us hit them,’ the resultant word means ‘the two of us just about hit them but we did not.’ The word <em>ampo’ittimalasarso·sana</em> could hardly be called an example of an “awkwardly simple grammar.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> It must be admitted that the San Blas put a good deal of meaning into very small insignificant items. This would seem to be very poor judgment on their part in attaching so much meaning to such a small element as the final suffix <em>-na</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You will admit, however, that English leaves a good deal of meaning to be borne by such small, generally unaccented words as <em>not</em> and <em>if</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I must admit that is true. From the type of illustration in the San Blas I would take it for granted that you could perhaps have a paradigm in some of these aboriginal languages even as extensive as in Greek.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You are a little more than right. Actually, with all the possible combinations of grammatical units, this stem <em>-sarso·-</em> in San Blas could probably appear in some 10,000 different combinations.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> My word! Is it possible? Imagine the task of a teacher having to teach natives to recite paradigms of 10,000 forms.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> In the first place, no one is ever called upon to teach the native children the 10,000 forms of the verbs. They learn to form words in the same way as English children learn to form complicated sentences. Children can form sentences because they have learned the patterns into which the words fit. In the same way San Blas children can use rather large words, for they learn the system into which the various elements fit. In exactly the same manner as you discovered the pattern for <em>anmala-</em> ‘we,’ so San Blas natives form their complex words.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> The factor which makes English so remarkable and so easy for people to understand is the crystal-clear word order. English shows orderliness of thinking. I presume that these aboriginal languages throw their words together in almost any fashion that they like or can devise.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You are quite wrong. This San Blas language has every bit as fixed a word order as we have in English. The subject expression normally occurs first, preceded and followed by various classes of attributives. The object expression follows the subject expression and this in turn may be preceded and followed by various classes of attributives. Third, the attributives of the verb occur, and finally, the verb expression. Following the verb there may occur certain stylistic words indicating whether the sentence is colloquial, oratorical, or poetical.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> This is almost elaborate enough to be considered an actual language.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It is most emphatically just that.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> You have chosen a very good example, I must concede. I’ll have to do some investigating of this subject myself to see what other features these primitive languages are credited with having.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Good! If your curiosity is aroused, that is all I could ask for, even though you do accuse me of a little misrepresentation.</p>
