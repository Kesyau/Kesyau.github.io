<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> However, in connection with these long words, which you intimate these aboriginal languages have, I would like to suggest that there is nothing particularly good about long words in themselves. The Indo-European languages have always avoided that tendency.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> In the first place, aboriginal languages do not all have long words. Aboriginal languages have all types of words. But as for Indo-European languages always avoiding long words, I’m not so sure. Consider the Gothic word <em>habaidedeima</em>, which is equivalent to Modern English <em>had</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Yes. That is exactly the point I have inferred. Consider that English by short words is getting rid of such excess baggage, and in doing so overcoming some abortive tendencies in the history of the Germanic languages.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> This doesn’t sound the same as your former argument about the aboriginal language attaching so much meaning to small units. However, even in the case of English, though we do have some short words, we still say <em>unattractive</em> when we could possibly get along with <em>ugly</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Possibly, Dr. Thompson. But tell me, is there any system to the inflection of these languages which is comparable to the excellency of the Greek noun?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> That can possibly be indicated best by giving you a paradigm in the Quechua language. A few of the possible forms are:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ika</td>
      <td>‘flower’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ikay</td>
      <td>‘my flower’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ikaykuna</td>
      <td>‘my flowers’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ikaykunaman</td>
      <td>‘to my flowers’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ikaykunamanta</td>
      <td>‘of my flowers’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ikaykunamantapacha</td>
      <td>‘from my flowers’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ikaykunamantapachalla</td>
      <td>‘from my flowers only’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>t’ikaykunamantapachallapis</td>
      <td>‘also from my flowers only’</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Indeed, it is a rather interesting type of paradigm. Very typical, indeed, isn’t it, of the agglutinative languages, where you keep on adding one element after another? I presume that you teach your students the gradual evolution of languages from the monosyllabic isolating languages such as Chinese, through the agglutinative stage as in the Polynesian, Quechua, and San Blas, finally to the perfection of the inflected type, such as the Indo-European. I remember that was what we learned concerning your so-called descriptive linguistics when I was a student at Harvard.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I fear then that you haven’t been studying any descriptive linguistics since that time, for such ideas are very much out of vogue today.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Is it possible? Why, I have been teaching that from my notes for many years.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It is advisable at times to revise notes, you know. However, such ideas are quite wrong about the evolution of language from the monosyllabic languages through the agglutinative stage and finally to the inflected languages such as Greek and Latin. Moreover, such speculation is decidedly not descriptive. The historical and comparative enthusiasts of the past generation have been responsible for such errors in interpretation of information, not the descriptive linguists.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> The theory seems very plausible and cogent.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Superficially it does seem so. One of the hitches in the entire idea is the fact that Chinese has been found to be the result of considerable change in itself. Chinese belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family of languages, and these languages at one time were polysyllabic and inflected, even as the research of Karlgren and others has so admirably demonstrated.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Is it possible?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Moreover, it is strange for you to assume that the Chinese should represent the most “primitive” language. Certainly there is no correlation between this and primitivism of culture that you have mentioned before.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But do you not find in general that the primitives of the world have this second type of language, namely, agglutinative?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It is true that a great percentage of primitive people of the world have agglutinative languages. It is also true that a similar percentage of all the languages of the world are agglutinative. However, many so-called primitives have inflected languages. There is surely no hard-and-fast correlation in this regard. Moreover, it is unwise to attempt to classify languages rigidly as monosyllabic, agglutinative, and inflected. This is not a mutually exclusive type of classification, for many languages have characteristics of all these three types. English, for example, has many monosyllabic words which are not inflected in grammatical structure. It also has some inflection, as in the pluralization of nouns and the formation of verbs, but in addition has what we may call agglutinative development in such a word as <em>ungentlemanliness</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Well then, setting aside both the first two groups, the monosyllabic and the agglutinative, as not giving us definite correlations, wouldn’t you say that the historically inflected languages of the Indo-European culture were the highest type of language to which mankind may evolve? Consider the remarkable cultural achievements of western civilization.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You have fallen into a common intellectual ditch. Because we are representatives of a culture that has attained the most advanced material stage so far achieved in human history is no indication that the way we cut our hair is the finest in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But what does the tonsorial culture of a people have to do with civilization?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Exactly nothing! That is the point. The fact that Indo-European peoples have an inflected language is an accident of history and no indication of intellectual superiority or of their being an advanced link in any evolutionary chain. The additional fact that in the nineteenth century the people of western civilization took upon themselves the “White Man’s Burden,” considerably for their own enrichment, and have had plenty of gunpowder to back up their ‘philanthropy’ is no special reason why their language or their hair-do represents the acme of perfection.</p>
