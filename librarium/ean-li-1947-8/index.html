<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> All that you say, Dr. Thompson, may be very true, but for the life of me, my academic proclivities and erudite sensibilities cannot refrain from being grievously affected when I think of bringing illiterate aboriginals into the sanctum of this place of learning to utter their crude guttural sounds, not simply as a curiosity to the students, but as an object of serious study by such fine students as Bill here. When illiterates become teachers, what place is there for rhetoric, the queen of the arts? What new things you primitivists will contrive!</p>

<p>But excuse the swan song of a nineteenth century rhetorician. Perhaps I should have been gathered to my fathers before this, but be that as it may, I really would like to know just what this course is going to include.</p>

<p><sup>[26]</sup> Here, Ann, you take over the conversation. I’ve interrupted it far too much already. However, I fear that if Dr. Thompson continues to make such flagrantly unclassical remarks as some I have heard this afternoon, I may have to re-enter the discussion. Hence, accept my apology now.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> You need not apologize, Dr. Zilch. It was a great deal nicer having you ask the questions and give the answers.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Well, you go ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> All right. First, Dr. Thompson, just what do you mean by “descriptive linguistics”?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Exactly what the word implies. It is the science of describing languages, and in this we pay no attention to the history of the language.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Excuse me, but this is incredible! Ignoring the tradition of history. Nothing is in its proper light without its history. But forgive me, I intruded again. I was sure I could refrain for a little while, at least.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> But it is a good question you introduce, Dr. Zilch. However, tell me how you would study the history of the Comanche language, when we have no documents of the language that are more than a few decades old at best. It does not have a recorded history.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But it must have had a history.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You’re right. The fact that I’m a man presupposes that once I was a boy, but if there were no eyewitnesses to any facts about me and no documents about me, and if I remember nothing about myself that I can relate, then a historian wouldn’t be very likely to want to reconstruct my past with no evidence on hand. In many ways unwritten languages are like that. There is no history, and the changes that have taken place have been so gradual that the speakers are not usually conscious of them.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But the functioning of a language is all tied up in its history. Consider the situation in English. How can you describe English without pointing out that <em>preach</em> is actually a compound word?</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> How do you mean that, Dr. Zilch?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Do you not remember, Bill, how I pointed out in <sup>[27]</sup> English Rhetoric III that <em>preach</em> comes from Latin <em>praedicare</em> “to proclaim.” The history of our language always comes in the fourth week of the course.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> I'm sorry; I had forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> By the name <em>compound</em> we normally designate combinations in which we can recognize free constituents, for example, such words as <em>blackbird</em>, <em>greenhouse</em>, and <em>breakwater</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But that is what is wrong with your denial of the value of historical studies. You are not able to recognize the ‘mutated compounds,’ such as <em>preach</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> I would call them ‘amputated,’ for there is nothing but the torso left, and that can only be identified by examining scars left by previous operations.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It seems to me that it would be safe to consider that preach comes in the same class of words as teach in English.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But by doing so you destroy that esoteric appreciation of the language.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Then we will have to conclude that languages do not function on an esoteric basis. I am quite convinced that one can speak English adequately and effectively for all social situations, and not know a thing about the history of the language. He might be able to use the form <em>oxen</em> and not realize that the <em>-en</em> formerly belonged to the stem of the word, and that the singular form <em>ox</em> is actually less than the historical stem.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Perhaps he could speak English, though I would venture to suggest, rather inadequately; but remember, my dear Dr. Thompson, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Well, in this case, we’ll leave it to the antiquarian to receive his compensating joy for all his efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> But Dr. Thompson, what about comparing other related languages? Don’t we do this in describing a language?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> We may, but if we do, we are dealing with comparative linguistics. Descriptive linguistics attempts to describe a language as a functional unit, quite apart from possible affiliations with other similar languages.</p>

<p><sup>[28]</sup> <strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> My word! How you do try to circumscribe knowledge! If you restrict yourself much more, Dr. Thompson, you'll be the veritable apostle of “learning more and more about less and less until you know everything about nothing.” For myself, I would choose the course of the polymath, ‘the learner of everything.’</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I presume that ultimately there isn’t much difference between knowing everything about nothing and knowing nothing correctly about everything.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Perhaps I should have refrained from my rejoinder. It is just a Victorian scholar’s reaction to novelty. But actually, Dr. Thompson, there is a part of me (I confess a rather small part) that is quite intrigued by all this newness.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Well, as I was saying before we took time off for a little verbal jostling, we also leave comparative studies out of a descriptive analysis. We do not, for example, point out in analyzing English that <em>stool</em> is an Anglo-Saxon root, and that <em>chair</em> comes in with the Norman-French, that <em>algebra</em> is from Arabic, <em>geometry</em> from Greek, <em>fossil</em> from Latin, <em>thug</em> from Hindustani, <em>macaroni</em> from Italian, <em>caravan</em> from Persian, <em>bamboo</em> from Malay, and <em>tepee</em> from Sioux. One can speak English every bit as well without knowing these facts.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Well, if descriptive linguistics doesn’t deal with the history of the language or other related languages, it certainly is not what I thought it was. I thought surely we’d be tracing the history of words, as we do in classes in rhetoric.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Your idea of linguistics is not far different from most people’s. They have the idea that it deals with etymologies and so-called “correct” usage. But descriptive linguistics deals with neither of these.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Is it possible that I heard you say that you do not consider problems of correctness in speech? Then you cast out completely my own science and art, rhetoric.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I fear that is what we do. For we do not describe what people ought to say, but what they do say.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Then you describe much error.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It is no doubt error from your basis of judgment, but we will all admit that it is usage.</p>

<p><sup>[29]</sup> <strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Such blatant non-conformity! But go on with the description of the method.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Surely. You might say that a descriptive linguist is like a botanist who sets out to describe all the vegetation within a given area and to point out the functional relationships of the vegetation to the general terrain. Of course, there are some historical observations that a trained botanist can make. He knows, for example, that deciduous forests generally follow coniferous forests. In the same way the linguist finds that [t] may change to [š] because of a front vowel, as illustrated in <em>educate</em> and <em>education</em>. On the other hand the reverse process of [š] changing to [t] is by no means a regularly observed process. The descriptive linguist points out what is a historical process in the [t] becoming [š], but he would not point out that the [č] in <em>chin</em> was formerly [k] and had become [č] by this process of palatalization. The descriptive linguist would have no occasion to point out this change, because the stem <em>chin</em> never occurs with a [k] sound in any derivative.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But why should not one point out every thing that he knows about every word as he goes?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> This tends to produce a very conglomerate sort of picture. We try to organize all material from a functional viewpoint. Shifting from one viewpoint to another produces a distorted picture. This is something like drawing a picture. In order to make everything appear real, we must maintain one point of view. That is to say, the basic lines of the perspective must all go toward one point. If we should change viewpoints while drawing the picture, the landscape would surely not look real. It is better to draw another picture, if we want to change viewpoints. That is why it is important to be constantly aware of our point of view. Comparative, historical, and descriptive linguistic data should not be mixed indiscriminately in the same picture.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> But what about the botanist? You must have had something more to say about him.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Several things, in fact. First, to make a comprehensive study he analyzes every plant. Some little saxifrage clinging to almost barren rocks is as significant to the botanist as the tall, beautiful trees. The botanist isn’t like the amateur nature-lover, who is only looking for spectacular things, nor does the botanist restrict his interest to rarities. Some people will go into the woods and spend <sup>[30]</sup> hours looking only for lady-slippers or tiger-lilies. Similarly some linguists only take delight in delving into some linguistic forest to come out with some rare beauty comprising a relatively unknown linguistic phenomenon, but in doing so they have often completely overlooked significant materials which give this rare item all its functional importance. The botanist has to take into account sunflowers and daisies and a good many plants whose flowers are so inconspicuous that the average person never looks at them.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> It appears that finally you’re implying that descriptive linguistics does have some content.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> This is one of its great problems. Its content is so stupendous. It would be impossible for a person to make a comprehensive description of Modern English in a lifetime given to the study of it.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> My word! I had thought that in the course which I offer in rhetoric, we handle English more or less adequately, and yet I do confess that there have been a few small points on which I have bestowed much perplexing thought.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You’ll be a descriptive linguist yet, Dr. Zilch. But back to our botanist. He doesn’t go about his task with any preconceived ideas of what he is going to find in any examination of an area. Furthermore, he hasn’t come to tell the hills what sort of vegetation they should produce, nor is he there to see to it that the vegetation is changed. He has come to describe what he finds. That is all.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> The botanist surely does have a great deal of technical terminology. My, what a headache botany was for me! Is linguistics as bad?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Fortunately, it is not. However, we must have some technical words for types of data which we discover in languages.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> But if the botanist is working in more or less unexplored territory, he is likely to find an entirely new plant. In such an event he simply gives it some made-up name. Is that what linguists do?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Precisely. If one investigates these unwritten languages which no one has studied, he is likely to find quite a few new features, especially in the types of ideas expressed by classes of affixes.</p>

<p><sup>[31]</sup> <strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> My dear man! Do you really mean to say that the great literary languages of the western world do not contain all the worthwhile categories of thought?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Dr. Zilch, you will have to visit the class after a few weeks and see what is happening in the study of an aboriginal language. Perhaps we’ll have the opportunity to discuss some of these factors at a later time.</p>
