<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> You mentioned that in aboriginal languages the tendency has been to borrow or to make up descriptive words, for evidently they cannot have the so-called technical vocabulary. What would aboriginals do with a word such as <em>bicycle</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It is difficult to say what they would do with <em>bicycle</em>, but hypothetically they could do any one of three principal things. They could borrow the word <em>bicycle</em> making whatever changes in the pronunciation are necessary to make it conform to the pattern of their language. This is what we may speak of as transliteration. The aboriginals might translate the word. This would be quite rare, for an aboriginal would not know that <em>bi-</em> means ‘two’ and <em>-cycle</em> ‘wheel.’ But presuming that we have a very smart and exceptional aboriginal, it is hypothetically possible that the resultant word would be something which would correspond to English ‘two-wheeler.’ Finally, the aboriginal might employ a descriptive word or phrase in his own language. This would be far more likely than the second possibility. In the early days some Indians of the Middle West did develop a phrase expression for a <em>bicycle</em> and called this “White man sits down to walk.”</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> It surely is a good functional name, to say the least. Descriptive names are the ones I attempt to invent when in writing an exam I cannot remember the technical vocabulary. I always hope that the person correcting the paper will think I am trying to be explicit and scientific rather than suspecting that I am covering up my ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> My word, but you students are a clever lot! I shall have to check more closely after this. I fear that I have been too lenient with those who ramble through their examinations with long descriptions.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Oh, Dr. Zilch, filling examination papers with a maximum of words on a minimum of information is undoubtedly one of the basic sciences of the university.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Is this a case of honest confession being good for the soul?</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Not altogether. Just a general observation about collegiate culture. However, I don’t know whether I would be able to employ so much verbiage in a descriptive linguistics course. It seems rather specific to me.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> It isn’t possible that you are contemplating taking up this study, is it? My dear Miss Ferrell, I assure you, you are really too much of the <em>beaux arts</em> type for this aboriginal linguistics, but – my apology to you, Dr. Thompson. I really do not want to discourage an apparently recent proselyte to your system.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> Excuse me for interrupting again, but you were talking about the ways in which words are formed for new items in culture, yet you didn’t mention the possibility of constructing a word out of thin air, simply inventing something absolutely new.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Strange as it may seem, such words are quite rare. <em>Kodak</em> appears to be one such artificially constructed word. At least it doesn’t come from any foreign language, and it doesn’t represent any morphemes that we can recognize in English.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I have often heard it said that the speakers of aboriginal languages often do not understand exactly what they say themselves. There is evidently a great lack of preciseness in their languages. Perhaps there is a good deal of inventing out of thin air in their words.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I should think that you would have been convinced of the falsehood of that type of statement from the grammatical structure that we have discussed so far.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> No, this is quite different. It has to do with the lexical phase of the problem and the meaning of words. Those who have worked with such languages imply that there is considerable looseness of meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Your contention does demand a word of explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> More than a word, I feel. You are rather too much inclined to pass things off as Q. E. D. without enough proof. You'll find me a rather stubborn antagonist.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Of course, I realize that I haven’t proved anything. I’ve only been suggesting some contradictory evidence to some of the matters which you have proposed. However, the impression of “looseness of meaning” results from the fact that words are not points of meaning, but areas of meaning; and all languages divide up phenomena into different areas.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> What do you mean by this “areas of meaning”? “Point preciseness” is what I teach.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> To answer this question, what would you say the meaning of red is?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Well, well, it is anything that is red, –er–uh–well–.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Even that isn’t too precise for an English rhetorician. What about Miss Ferrell’s blouse? Is it red?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Indeed so.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> But it’s really “burgundy,” Dr. Zilch.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But that is red, positively!</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Well, what about the trimming on the girl’s hat over to the left of the counter? What color is it?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Why, that is red too.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> What would you call it, Miss Ferrell?</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> I would say that it is “cerise.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Then what about the scarf worn by the young lady by the window?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Red. Quite red in fact!</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> What is your verdict, Miss Ferrell?</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Well, we girls would call it “vermilion.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I suppose that you would say my tie is red, would you not, Dr. Zilch?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Right.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> But my wife informs me that it is “rust.” What is your judgment, Miss Ferrell?</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> It most surely is “rust.”</p>
