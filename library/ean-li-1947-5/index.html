<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But if you will not take into consideration the cultural attainments of the people, surely you must have to take into consideration the physical make-up of the people when you analyze languages. This must be especially true in connection with the sounds.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> What do you mean?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Exactly this. You surely must expect the Negro with his broad lips to produce the broad vowels. He is physiologically conditioned to speak in a particular manner.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I cannot agree with you at all in this matter. I remember the shock which I had when I heard a Negro who was raised and educated in the Bahamas and England speak with an accent which seemed to echo from the very walls of Oxford. I have likewise heard Negroes glide beautifully through French which they had learned in Algiers, or trip along with a staccato pronunciation of Spanish which they had learned as their native tongue in Mexico.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But tell me then why the Negro of the United States speaks with an accent which is different from my speech.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> The basic reason for this is that his speech is in general like that of the South, and even where the Negro has moved north he has to a great extent carried this speech with him. Furthermore, the Negro in the United States so often lives in a linguistic community separated from the Whites, except in the matter of business, that the Negro dialect is less affected by the dialect of the Whites than are two contiguous dialects spoken by Whites. I have heard Negroes speak who were raised entirely with Whites, and their speech did not indicate the slightest deviation from the common standard.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Then what about Orientals coming to this country?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> The same thing applies. I have Japanese and Chinese friends who have been raised here in the United States and whose speech doesn’t contain the slightest trace of any “foreign” accent.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> What you say, Dr. Thompson, is very different from what one has been led to believe by others. This bears investigation. However, in connection with the aboriginal languages that have been mentioned I would like to comment about the situation involving vocabulary. Surely such primitives cannot have very extensive vocabularies. Limited cultures must imply limited vocabularies.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It is true that people do not need to have any more words than they have referents in their lives. But I am inclined to believe that we are very likely to underestimate our primitive aboriginal friends.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> “Friends” sounds like an anthropologist turned humanitarian.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I presume that you are right. After learning to know such people, who have so many remarkable qualities, it is hard to think of them except as friends.</p>

<p>But relative to the point we were discussing, you may be assured that aboriginal peoples have plenty of vocabulary to express all the ideas they have. Even introductory and superficial examinations reveal that most so-called aboriginal languages have well over 20,000 words, if we count words as in English including all regular derivatives as new words, namely, counting <em>educate</em> as one word and <em>education</em> as another and <em>educational</em> as a third.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> Excuse me, Dr. Thompson, but what about words for ‘car,’ ‘locomotive,’ ‘dynamo,’ ‘airplane,’ ‘radio,’ etc., things which aboriginal peoples don’t have?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Rather, excuse me, Bill. Dr. Zilch and I have been talking so much that I’m afraid we haven’t given you or Miss Ferrell a chance to interrupt.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> That’s perfectly all right. I really don’t know enough to discuss linguistics intelligently. Anyway, the discussion is answering exactly the problems I have been wondering about. So please go ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> However, your question about new things in the material culture of primitive people is a good one. We have acquired new things in our culture and we have always managed to obtain a name for them. Sometimes we import the name along with the article as in the case of <em>spaghetti</em>, which we have taken over from Italian. For some items in our culture such as <em>bicycle</em> and <em>locomotive</em> we have employed Greek and Latin derivatives. At other times we use descriptive words with English constituents and form a compound such as <em>airplane</em>. Aboriginal languages do not have any such “learned” vocabulary from which to construct words as we do from Greek and Latin, but they do borrow words for things, even as a Tarahumara Indian calls a table a [mésači], borrowing <em>mesa</em> ‘table’ from Spanish and making a good Tarahumara word out of it by adding the derivative suffix [-či].</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> I never could understand why all sciences had to borrow so persistently from Greek and Latin. Why say <em>biology</em> when we could say <em>life-science</em>, or <em>gastropod</em> when we could say <em>stomach-foot</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> It would be much less scientific.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I would not agree with you, except for the fact that science is the common heritage of all of western culture and that, since the classical languages are part of this common heritage, it is a convenience that terms should be taken from such languages. When one knows the so-called scientific term, then he has very little difficulty recognizing this in scientific writings in any European language. On the other hand, he would be obliged to learn many new terms if he cared to do research work and investigate the findings of those who have employed foreign languages in describing their work.</p>
