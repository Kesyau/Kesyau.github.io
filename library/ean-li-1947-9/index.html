<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Good! I shall be glad to. But tell me, how is your course divided? I suppose that you spend most of the time studying phonetics. I remember that they were beginning to teach that subject when I was in the university.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Phonetics is a comparatively small part of the course.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But you have to be able to record the sounds of these strange exotic languages, do you not? I imagine that you have to learn as many as a hundred sounds, if you are to be an expert.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You are rather conservative, Dr. Zilch. We actually analyze several hundred sounds in the course, learning to record and reproduce them.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> But do we have to learn several hundred different symbols? That would be awful.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> No indeed. We employ the regular roman letters for the basic sound types, but by adding diacritical marks we can distinguish many different types.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> What do these sounds look like then?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> If one of you will lend me a scrap of paper, I’ll show you some of the signs that we may add to a <em>p</em> to indicate different phonetic values.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Gladly. Here, use this sheet.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Thank you. Here are some of the more common combinations of <em>p</em> with the diacritical marks:</p>

<div lang="la">

<p>[p], [p̶], [‘p], [p‘], [p̍], [pˀ], [pˤ], [p͐], [p᷾], [p̮], [pʷ], [p̡], [pʸ], [p̨], [p̰], [p̶ˀ], [p̶ʷ], [p̶̨], [p̶̨ʸ], [p̶͐], [p̶̡], [p̡̍ʷ]</p>

<p>The [p] indicates that we are dealing with a bilabial <sup>[32]</sup> voiceless stop. If we put a line [–] through it as in [p̶], we indicate that the bilabial is a continuant. The reversed apostrophe [‘], depending on its location, indicates aspiration either before or after the stop. The single apostrophe [ˈ] indicates synchronous glottalization of the stop. The symbol [ˀ] indicates egressive pharynx air following the stop, and [ˁ] indicates ingressive pharynx air. Similarly, an arrow pointing right [˃] indicates egressive mouth air and the symbol [˂] indicates ingressive mouth air. A curve below the letter [ ̮] shows labialization in which the resultant sound comprises only one segment. The raised [ʷ] is used when two segments are formed in the sound. The mark [ ̡] indicates palatalization with one segment and the raised [ʸ] is employed when there are two segments in the sound. Nasalization is indicated by [˛] and pharyngealization by [˷]. These are the principal types of diacriticals. But one can readily see that with the various potential combinations it is possible to indicate a great variety of sounds which may occur in any language. Not all linguists employ diacriticals in precisely this manner, but any system may be used if one defines the values accurately and is consistent.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> The texts which you publish in these aboriginal languages must look grotesquely complicated with all these strange sounds and fine shades of distinction in sound.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Surprisingly enough that is not the case. Phonetics consists in the analysis of all the fine distinctions of sound, but phonemics constitutes the methodology of analyzing the features about these sounds that ‘count.’ A Phonetics elaborates all the distinctions, and phonemics simplifies, choosing just those sound features which have significance for the language in question. Phonemics is the science of proper alphabet construction. As a friend of mine, Dr. Pike, has said, “Phonetics gathers raw material. Phonemics cooks it.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I’m glad to hear you discuss phonemics, for I have been wondering for some time what it was all about. You evidently consider phonetics and phonemics as quite separate, do you not? But are they equally important?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Indeed, the two subjects are different. As to the matter of the relative importance of phonetics and phonemics, I would say from investigating problems involving translations into various aboriginal languages that phonemics is of even greater significance to the linguist than phonetics.</p>

<p><sup>[33]</sup> <strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> What types of problems do you find, for example?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Consider a situation which arose in checking the orthography of Yipounou, a Bantu language of the Gabon. Three different letters had been employed for one and the same sound unit, which was a voiced velar continuant and which may be written phonetically as [g̵]. Before the vowel [u] this voiced continuant somewhat approximates the English [w], and before an [i] the sound is somewhat like English [y]. Before all other vowels the sound is more like English [g]. Hence the traditional orthography employed [w], [y], and [g] to symbolize what is one single unit in the Yipounou. But the difficulty consists in the fact that there is another sound also written as [w] in the language, as well as another [y] sound. Mistakes of this type make it exceptionally hard for natives to learn to read their own language. To teach natives to write their own language is a much more difficult task when one has arbitrary distinctions in the language made only because the orthography employs distinctions which have significance in English, but not in the aboriginal language.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> I’m beginning to see some light on the situation. I recognize now why you insisted on excluding comparative linguistic material. Evidently the object is to describe a language on the basis of its own system and that alone.</p>
