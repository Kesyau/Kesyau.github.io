<blockquote>这本书采用对话的形式写，是受了美国Eugene A. Nida的&emsp14;<em>Linguistic Interludes</em>&emsp14;一书的启发。Nida的书深入浅出，引人入胜。虽然是三十年前读的，至今还有很深的印象。我应该在这里向他表示谢意。</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> Ann, this is Dr. Thompson, whom I heard last night discussing morphemes and phonemes. Dr. Thompson, this is my friend Ann Ferrell.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> How do you do, Miss Ferrell?</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> I am so glad to meet you, Dr. Thompson. Bill has been raving about linguistics all morning.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I’m glad to hear that the lecture seems to have impressed at least one person.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Indeed it has! Do sit down and join us, Dr. Thompson.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Gladly. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> What I like best about this technique you presented last night is that it is so new and different.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Well, in some ways that is the case, but actually it is rather old stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> What do you mean? We’ve certainly never received it from any of the other profs here at the university.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> It may seem strange, but without doubt the finest pieces of descriptive work were done by Sanskrit grammarians before the time of Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> Then why haven’t we been hearing about these descriptive methods before now?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Most linguists of the past century were too much taken up by the study of the history of European languages to bother very much with describing languages. Then, too, the rhetoricians, who have had a rather heavy incubus around their necks in the form of the Latin and Greek grammatical apparatus, have been rather slow to introduce new methods into the study of languages.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> You are evidently quite opposed to the classical view of grammar. You should have a chance to meet Dr. Horatio Zilch. He is the principal protagonist among the old-school grammarians here.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Yes. Someone mentioned Dr. Zilch to me yesterday.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> I presume that I might as well tell you that in his office this morning he delivered some rather strong bombast against you and the descriptive linguists. A friend of mine, Charles Morgan, told me last hour about it. I can well believe it, for I used to take rhetoric and grammar from “Old Horatio.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I’m glad to hear he’s talking about the course. It doesn’t make much difference what is said. If people can be made curious, we’ll have a good class of curiosity-seekers. Actually, being curious is the best foundation for scholarship. Eternal curiosity and knowledge of how to satisfy that curiosity make a research person. I do hope that I can meet Dr. Zilch.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> You may be assured that Dr. Zilch is anxious to meet you, for he heard you last night. Dr. Zilch often comes into the co-op here for tea about this time in the afternoon. I’ll keep an eye open for him.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Dr. Thompson, Bill told me that in the course you are going to use native speakers of various aboriginal languages. Why do you do that, for goodness sakes?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> That is a rather big question. However, have you ever heard that if one wants to study oneself, the best thing is to look at others; and vice versa, when one wants to study others, one must look at oneself. If we look at languages which have utterly different structures, we are likely to get rid of some of the preconceived ideas that we have had about languages because we have known only English or perhaps one or two other more or less related languages.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> How different can these aboriginal languages be?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> They can be different in almost any and every detail. But here is a specific example. Some languages do not have words which correspond in the function of the grammar to our adjectives.</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> How would they ever say <em>the good man</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> The speakers of such languages would say ‘the man goods,’ for they express by verbs what we express by adjectives.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> One minute, Dr. Thompson. Dr. Zilch just came in. Would you like to have him join us?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> By all means.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> He’s a rather opinionated person, as I told you.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> That’s fine. I’d rather know people who have wrong ideas than those who have no ideas at all. But which one of the men, standing by the counter is he? I may perhaps have met him at the faculty meeting, but I do not remember.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> Dr. Zilch is the rather large, heavy-set man, with the black homburg hat, gold-headed cane over his arm, glasses tied to a ribbon, and that big Phi Beta Kappa key that hangs like a medal of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Oh yes. I do recognize him.</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> I’ll step over and invite him to drink his tea with us.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Good.</p>

<p>[Bill Downing goes to get Dr. Zilch.]</p>

<p><strong>Ann Ferrell:</strong> Dr. Zilch is really a very fine old fellow. His ideas are rather conventional and authoritative. That is especially hard for Bill to swallow, but “Old Horatio,” as we call him behind his back, is really a pretty good “Joe.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> I’m sure I shall like him.</p>
