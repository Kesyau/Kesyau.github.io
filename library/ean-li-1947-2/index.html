<p>[Bill Downing returns with Dr. Zilch.]</p>

<p><strong>Bill Downing:</strong> Dr. Zilch, this is Dr. Thompson, and I’m sure you know Ann Ferrell.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> How do you do, Ann? I’m delighted to see you. And Dr. Thompson, this is indeed a pleasure to meet you again. I have been looking forward to having some brief opportunity to chat with you. There are so many items that I want to take up with you, having heard your lecture last night; but first, do explain what you said about bringing in speakers of primitive languages for the study of linguistics. What can these simple natives contribute to a university?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Perhaps your difficulty lies in the fact that you consider the so-called primitive aboriginals as being essentially simple, naïve, and barren as regards cultural achievements. This may be somewhat the fault of calling them “primitive peoples.” It would be better to speak of such people and languages as being non-literate. In terms of cultural achievements and adaptation to human needs, these peoples may have surpassed us.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> Pure unadulterated primitivism! That’s all! What can they show us?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Your reactions are not strange. Miss Ferrell was asking me about this aspect of the course before you joined us. Perhaps I could say that the main purpose of such work with aboriginal languages is to obtain a fresh approach.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But by aboriginal languages, you mean unwritten ones!</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> That’s right. Ones which are not regularly written by the natives themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> That means then that there is no literature, no poetry, drama, stories, not a Shakespeare or a Demosthenes in the crowd. Don’t you feel, Dr. Thompson, that you are wasting precious years of students’ time, having them study languages that have no recognized literary tradition?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> That may very well seem to be the case. But there are two factors involved. First, linguistics is not the study of literature. That is technically philology. Linguistics deals simply with language, any type of language, and anyone’s language.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> But why not make your study the analysis of noble speech and language, rather than a series of some inarticulate aboriginal grunts?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> We’ll come to that in a moment. However, first be assured that I agree most heartily in the study of literary productions. They are very worthwhile. But Dr. Zilch, don’t you believe that there is value in studying something which society uses as much as language, something without which we could have absolutely no organized society and culture?</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I suppose that one is justified in the study of such matters as the economics of a people, but for me that is far too banal.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Well, linguistics is in some degree more fundamental than economics. Without language such exchange as we know would not exist. Language is a vital part of all our living. In some ways there is a distinct parallelism between economics and descriptive linguistics. If we are going to describe the economic life of a people, we have to consider Joe Zlaket, who runs the corner fruit-stand, as well as the multimillionaire. Similarly, if we are going to describe the language of a people, we must be concerned with Joe Zlaket’s speech, just as well as Shakespeare’s. You could not obtain a balanced picture of the economic life of the United States by analyzing only the business dealings of the Rockefeller family, any more than one can obtain an accurate picture of the function of a language in society by limiting research to Shakespeare. I dare say, too, that just as we know better the significance of the Rockefeller dealings after studying the economic life of the little business man, so we can even bring some light to bear on the language of the literary masters by knowing the linguistic usage of the “butchers, the bakers, and the candlestick-makers.”</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> I admit that you descriptive linguists seem to have some purpose in what you are doing, and if you wish to waste your time studying languages with a few hundred words and trying to describe how the natives make out their meaning with grunts and gesticulation, that is all right with me. I do hope, however, that you do not play the Pied Piper here in the university and lead aside our really serious students.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> You have made out quite a case against me, haven’t you, Dr. Zilch? Perhaps descriptive linguists are not as bad as you have depicted them. The impression that people with a primitive material culture…</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> There you go again, speaking exactly as an anthropologist would.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Thompson:</strong> Is speaking like an anthropologist actually as bad as all that? He simply studies all types of people, rather than a select few as in the case of the biographer or the historian. It is true, however, that we descriptive linguists and the anthropologists have much in common.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Zilch:</strong> That’s right—primitivism.</p>
